# Amazon Clone Project

## Project Overview

The **Amazon Clone** project is a responsive web application that mimics the front-end interface of Amazon, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. The project is developed using HTML and CSS to replicate the design and layout of Amazon’s homepage and shopping sections. Although the project does not include full backend functionality, it demonstrates essential front-end skills like layout design, responsiveness, and UI components.

## Features
**Responsive Design:** The website is responsive and adjusts according to the screen size, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices (e.g., mobile, tablet, and desktop).
**Navbar & Search Functionality:** The website features a fully styled navigation bar with a logo, search bar, and other elements like address, sign-in, and cart sections.
**Hero Section:** A hero section showcasing Amazon’s promotional banners and advertisements, replicating the typical shopping experience.
**Product Section:** A product grid displaying a variety of product images and categories. Each product box has hover effects and provides category links for users.
**Footer Section:** The footer includes useful links and a copyright notice, styled to mimic Amazon’s official layout.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5:** The structure of the web pages.
**CSS3:** The design and styling of the pages, including custom fonts, hover effects, and animations.
**Flexbox:** Used for layout positioning and responsiveness.
**Media Queries:** Ensures the website is mobile-friendly and adjusts for different screen sizes.

Future Enhancements
In future versions, I plan to add:

**JavaScript Integration:** Implement dynamic content such as search functionality, cart updates, and user interactions.
**Backend Functionality:** Implement a backend using Node.js or Python, and database integration (MongoDB, MySQL) to store user and product information.
**Authentication System:** A login and signup system to allow users to create accounts and view personalized data.


Credits
This project was developed as part of my **Bachelor in Computer Application (BCA)** coursework. The design is heavily inspired by Amazon's original layout but is created from scratch for learning purposes.
